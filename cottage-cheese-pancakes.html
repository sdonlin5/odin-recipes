    <h2>These family-friendly high-protein, low-fat, simple cottage cheese pancakes have a fluffy texture with a wholesome, subtly sweet flavor. </h2>
    <p><em>No one</em> is more surprised than me at how legit these pancakes are! As someone who claimed for years not to like cottage cheese, these pancakes were the gateway that finally made me a believer. These are high-protein, low-fat pancakes with three simple ingredients that cook up fluffy and actually taste good. If it sounds too good to be true, I assure you itâ€™s not.</p>
    <p>The crisp edges, soft, tender center, and wholesome, subtly sweet flavor make them not just good, but go back for seconds and wake up 15 minutes early to make these on a weekday good. Enjoy them with a drizzle of maple syrup, switch it up with a dollop of jam, or go for another boost of protein with some Greek yogurt and fresh fruit.</p>
