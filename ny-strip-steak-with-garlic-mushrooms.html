            <li>8oz New York strip steaks</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons minced garlic per steak</li>
            <li>1 pinch of rosemary per steak</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon flaked sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Fried Garlic Mushrooms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound small button mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
                <li>1-2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>New York Strip Steak</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the lemon juice and the olive oil in a shallow container large enough to hold the steaks in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Place the steaks into the oil, then turn to coat both sides in the oil and lemon juice mixture. Salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>Rub the minced garlic over the steaks, then sprinkle the rosemary all over the steaks as well. ( I like a lot of rosemary, so how much is up to you!) </li>
            <li>Let the steaks stand at room temperature in the container for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>To cook the steak, remove the steaks from the marinade and place on a clean plate, making sure to discard the marinade.</li>
            <li>Heat your BBQ or grill to high temp, oiling the grill or grates on your barbecue if they tend to stick - you don't want these to stick!</li>
            <li>Place the steaks on the grill and cook the steaks until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest portion registers your desired degree of doneness, See my notes in the post above for the beef cooking temperatures and doneness.</li>
            <li>Place the streaks onto a cutting board and then tent the steaks loosely with foil. Let stand 5 minutes. Remove the foil and cut steaks across the grain into slices.</li>
            <li>Arrange the steak slices on a platter.</li>
        </ol>
            <h4>Fried Garlic Mushrooms</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To prepare the mushrooms, start them 10 minutes before you start the steak. I then leave them with the lid on to stay warm while the steak finishes.</li>
                <li>Place the butter in a large skillet on medium-high heat. Add in the mushrooms and fry for 10-15 minutes, or until they have reduced in size and released most of their water content.</li>
                <li>Add in the garlic when the mushrooms are done and fry for 2-3 minutes. To keep warm, simply cover and keep on the burner ( turn the burner off and let the residual heat keep them warm,)</li>
        </ol>
